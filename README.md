# Json Entity Blueprint (JEB)

The JEB library is intended to aid in the creation Java REST services within the Spring framework.  Many Spring projects that implement REST services require a glue layer to convert business entities stored in a relational database into simple java objects that can be easily serialized into Json responses via Jackson.  This project aims to make that glue layer unnecessary.
